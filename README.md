# First project more or less
Doing a course in frontend and need a project which i can develop during the same time. The plan is to make a website from scratch, I have a personal  interest in computer hardware so it's gonna be catered towards that. The end goal is to have a front-end website with everything needed to start implanting the backend.


# -Design notes-

Done a design for my website, haven't done any form of color, depth, element values or corrections. Normally I would make it within the design processes, making it over all easier later on if the values and design is set before the building processes.
I'm here to learn coding, so I would rather do it in the code this time around. Which gives me the option to choose how to do it in my next project.
